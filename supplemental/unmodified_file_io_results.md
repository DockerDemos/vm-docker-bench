## Unmodified File I/O Results ##

_Note: This test may not be an accurate representation of actual results.  The available disk space on the primary host without a hypervisor was not large enough to create a file big enough to prevent caching in memory.  See the "Modified File I/O Operation" test below for a better, but probably still not 100% accurate, attempt at this test._
